## DistilBERT Model

DistilBERT is a computationally efficient version of BERT, a widely-used transformer-based model for natural language processing tasks. It has been pre-trained on extensive data, enabling it to capture bidirectional contextual information, which is particularly important for understanding the nuances of Hindi language structures.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch is used as the deep learning framework for model development, leveraging its capabilities in building and training neural networks, especially in tasks like natural language processing.
- **Datasets:** The project uses datasets sourced from HASOC (Hate Speech and Offensive Content), spanning the years 2019-2021, to capture a diverse collection of social media interactions and product reviews in Hindi.
- **Preprocessing:** The data is preprocessed to ensure uniformity and prepare it for training and evaluation.
- **Training and Evaluation:** The DistilBERT model is trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated rigorously on test data to showcase its effectiveness in deciphering sentiments within the intricate tapestry of Hindi expressions.

## Results and Insights

The project aims to bridge the gap between the demand for sentiment analysis in Hindi text and the capabilities offered by DistilBERT. By showcasing the model's proficiency in discerning subtle nuances and cultural connotations, it highlights the importance of accurate sentiment analysis in areas like e-commerce and social media moderation.
